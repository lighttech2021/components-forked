# Signoz Design System

This guide explains how to use Signoz design system powered by Turborepo, React, and Storybook.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:ahmadshaheer/signoz-design-system-2.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the packages:

   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```

4. Start Storybook:
   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Useful Commands

- `pnpm build` - Build all packages, including the Storybook site
- `pnpm dev` - Run all packages locally and preview with Storybook
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages
- `pnpm changeset` - Generate a changeset
- `pnpm clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders

## Available Packages

- `@signoz/theme`: Core React component
- `@signoz/tailwind-config`: UI configuration, including Tailwind CSS setup
- `@signoz/button`: Button component
- `@signoz/input`: Input component

## Creating a New Package

To create a new package:

1. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/new-package-name
   ```

2. From the root of the project, run:

   ```sh
   pnpm turbo gen new-package
   ```

   When creating a new package, you'll be prompted to provide a name and description for it. Enter these details as requested. For example:

   - Package name: Enter a name that corresponds to a shadcn component (e.g., "dropdown-menu")
   - Description: Provide a brief explanation of the package's purpose

   e.g.

   ```sh
   ❯ pnpm turbo gen new-package
   turbo 2.1.2


   >>> Modify "design-system" using custom generators

   ? What is the name of the new package? dropdown-menu
   ? Provide a brief description of the package: dropdown menu package
   ```

   Executing this generator will automatically set up and configure the new package with the necessary files and structure.

   ```
   ├── apps
   │   └── docs
   │       ├── package.json (modified)
   │       └── stories
   │           └── dropdown-menu.stories.tsx (new)
   ├── packages
   │   └── dropdown-menu
   │       ├── .eslintrc.js (new)
   │       ├── components.json (new)
   │       ├── package.json (new)
   │       ├── postcss.config.js (new)
   │       ├── src
   │       │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx (new)
   │       │   ├── index.css (new)
   │       │   └── lib
   │       │       └── utils.ts (new)
   │       ├── tailwind.config.js (new)
   │       ├── tsconfig.app.json (new)
   │       ├── tsconfig.json (new)
   │       └── vite.config.ts (new)
   ```

3. Make the necessary changes:

   - Modify the component (e.g. `packages/dropdown-menu/src/dropdown-menu.tsx`)
   - Add a storybook story in `apps/docs/stories/dropdown-menu.stories.tsx`

4. From the root of the project, commit the changes to the new branch:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new package: dropdown-menu"
   ```

5. From the root of the project, run:

   ```sh
   pnpm update-version
   ```

   This will guide you through the process of creating a changeset, which is used to document changes and manage version bumps.

   #### It will prompt you with the following:

   - Which packages would you like to include? – This shows which packages and changed and which have remained the same. By default, no packages are included. Press space to select the packages you want to include in the changeset.
   - Which packages should have a major bump? – Press space to select the packages you want to bump versions for.
   - If doing the first major version, confirm you want to release.
   - Write a summary for the changes.
   - Confirm the changeset looks as expected.
   - A new Markdown file will be created in the changeset folder with the summary and a list of the packages included.

6. Push the changes to the remote repository:

   ```sh
   git push origin feature/new-package-name
   ```

7. Create a new PR
8. After the PR gets merged, the selected packages (that were specified in step 5) will be released/updated to npmjs.com
